The program provide students with a Google mentor, an interactive introduction to computer science, and supplemental computer science courses.

The 100% virtual program includes:

In this course I participated in a 2-week intensive introductory project-based python taught by Google engineers. I learn the Basic Principles of Python and applied 
this concept in the projects. In this repository you can see 7 projects which help me to apply my knowledge.
