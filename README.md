# Google-Mentorship-and-Development-program
Projects created in Google CSSI online program 

Google Mentorship and Development is a program to prepare students for an education and potential career opportunities in computer science. 
The program provide students with a Google mentor, an interactive introduction to computer science, and supplemental computer science courses.

The 100% virtual program includes:

A 1:1 mentorship with a Google engineer throughout the duration of the program
A cohort based introduction to CS fundamentals and career navigation skills with support from Google engineers
Free access to a Google created, self-paced educational resource designed to build data structures and algorithms knowledge and Coursera's Data Structures 
and Algorithms Specialization course
Exclusive access to resources, updates, and invitations to Google events

In this course I participated in a 2-week intensive introductory project-based python taught by Google engineers. I learn the Basic Principles of Python and applied 
this concept in the projects. In this repository you can see 7 projects which help me to apply my knowledge. I listed below some of them.

Air Hockey Game:
Air Hockey Game project is written in Python. Itâ€™s a two-player game, playing against each other. After starting the game, 
the player has to move the paddle from left to right, up and down to block the ball from entering the scoring area

Empire State:
In this project I applied my knowledge of functions. I used some functions such as mousePressed, mouseWheel, KeyPressed. The image gate larger in size when the user 
press the key == 'a' and reduce in size when the user click the image. Then a second image will appear when the user press the key == 'e' and with the same key the size will increment

Paint Project:
This project is written in Python.The application allows the user to simulate painting on the computer by using the mouse. This program provide a basic set of painting tools such as change colors, erase and change the size of the lines.
